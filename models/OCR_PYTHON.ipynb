from Historical\n","Perspectives\n","\n","Dipankar Dasgupta\n","Department of Computer Science\n","University of Memphis\n","Memphis, USA\n","dasgupta@memphis.edu\n","\n","Abstract—Many applications of Generative AI (such as DALL-\n","E, GPT-3, ChatGPT, etc.) are making headline news in recent\n","months and have been receiving both praise and criticism for\n","their far reaching implications. Some of these applications include\n","query responses, language translation, text to images and videos,\n","composing stories, essays, creating arts and music, generating\n","programs, etc. This review provides an historical background of\n","Generative AI techniques and how they evolved over the years.\n","This report highlights the benefits of Generative AI technologies\n","and their limitations/challenges in moving forward. It is also to be\n","noted that the large-scale applications of AI and their successes\n","are now possible due to exponential advances in hardware\n","(computational power, storage capacity), cloud computing and\n","related operational layers of software.\n","\n","Index Terms—Machine Learning, Deep Neural Network, Evo-\n","lutionary Computation, Language Learning Model, Transformer,\n","ete.\n","\n","I. INTRODUCTION\n","\n","“AI is not magic, it is logic’—Mathematics and statistics are\n","underlying building blocks of all AI algorithms and require\n","in-depth knowledge of techniques to efficiently solve different\n","real-world problems |}. There exists more than fifty so-called\n","AI algorithms and heuristics. While some AI techniques are\n","model-based, most others are data-driven and rely on large\n","training datasets; also data quality and their properties (such\n","as dimensionality, distributions, and 5-Vs of Bigdata (2) gen-\n","erally affect classification, recognition, and prediction tasks.\n","\n","For more than a decade, Al-based applications have been\n","developed for several applications including controversial\n","ones. For instance, image morphing (Face2Face, FaceApp)\n","which can automatically modify someone’s face to add a smile,\n","make younger or older looking faces, or swap genders. Such\n","apps can provide “beautifying” effects that include smoothing\n","out wrinkles and, more controversially, lightening the skin.\n","Such Al-based tools are also making it easy to generate\n","realistic videos, and impersonate someone so that a person’s\n","facial expressions match those of someone being tracked\n","using a depth-sensing camera [26]. Other AI tools (such as\n","Lyrebird) are used to impersonate another person’s voice and\n","manipulate reality. Similarly, large language models (LLMs)\n","have recently gained widespread popularity due to their ability\n","to produce human-like answers to questions. At the same time,\n","several questions remain about misinformation/disinformation\n","\n"," \n","\n","Deepak Venugopal\n","Department of Computer Science\n","University of Memphis\n","Memphis, USA\n","dvenugopal @memphis.edu\n","\n","Kishor Datta Gupta\n","Department of Computer Science\n","Clark Atlanta University\n","Atlanta, USA\n","kgupta@cau.edu\n","\n","that may be spread through the use of these models and the\n","far-reaching impact of these models on future student learning\n","and development.\n","\n","All these technological transformations are possible due\n","to hardware/software advances (such as massive computation\n","power and exponential growth in storage capabilities). While\n","Al-based tools are showing significant benefits, there is also an\n","inherent danger that several so-called AI industry experts may\n","use these powerful technologies as a blackbox without deep\n","understanding of how they work and their inherent limitations.\n","\n","II. LESSONS FROM THE PAST\n","\n","Search and optimization are key to all AI algorithms,\n","these use different similarity measures (pattern matching) to\n","provide guided search in representation or problem space. To\n","accomplish proper guiding, selection schemes, fitness function,\n","loss function, transfer function, matching functions have been\n","used to achieve to the desired goal. Most AI algorithms\n","are probabilistic where the results need to be converted to\n","decision or recommendation space. In general, performances\n","of AI algorithms largely depend on tuning various control\n","parameters (both internal and external), mapping functions,\n","encoding schemes, distance measures, recognition thresholds,\n","meta-heuristics, etc. Also for a specific application, hybridiza-\n","tion of AI techniques, data pre-processing (sampling and di-\n","mensionality reduction) and post-processing (output filtering,\n","and visual interpretation) play important roles in algorithmic\n","success\n","\n"," \n","\n","A.

Some of these applications include\\nquery responses, language translation, text to images and videos,\\ncomposing stories, essays, creating arts and music, generating\\nprograms, etc. This review provides an historical background of\\nGenerative AI techniques and how they evolved over the years.\\nThis report highlights the benefits of Generative AI technologies\\nand their limitations/challenges in moving forward. It is also to be\\nnoted that the large-scale applications of AI and their successes\\nare now possible due to exponential advances in hardware\\n(computational power, storage capacity), cloud computing and\\nrelated operational layers of software.\\nIndex Terms—Machine Learning, Deep Neural Network, Evo-\\nlutionary Computation, Language Learning Model, Transformer,\\nete.\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\n“AI is not magic, it is logic’—Mathematics and statistics are\\nunderlying building blocks of all AI algorithms and require\\nin-depth knowledge of techniques to efficiently solve different\\nreal-world problems |}. There exists more than fifty so-called\\nAI algorithms and heuristics. While some AI techniques are\\nmodel-based, most others are data-driven and rely on large\\ntraining datasets; also data quality and their properties (such\\nas dimensionality, distributions, and 5-Vs of Bigdata (2) gen-\\nerally affect classification, recognition, and prediction tasks.\\nFor more than a decade, Al-based applications have been\\ndeveloped for several applications including controversial\\nones. For instance, image morphing (Face2Face, FaceApp)\\nwhich can automatically modify someone’s face to add a smile,\\nmake younger or older looking faces, or swap genders. Such\\napps can provide “beautifying” effects that include smoothing\\nout wrinkles and, more controversially, lightening the skin.\\nSuch Al-based tools are also making it easy to generate\\nrealistic videos, and impersonate someone so that a person’s\\nfacial expressions match those of someone being tracked\\nusing a depth-sensing camera [26]. Other AI tools (such as\\nLyrebird) are used to impersonate another person’s voice and\\nmanipulate reality. Similarly, large language models (LLMs)\\nhave recently gained widespread popularity due to their ability\\nto produce human-like answers to questions. At the same time,\\nseveral questions remain about misinformation/disinformation\\ndvenugopal @memphis.edu\\nthat may be spread through the use of these models and the\\nfar-reaching impact of these models on future student learning\\nand development.\\nAll these technological transformations are possible due\\nto hardware/software advances (such as massive computation\\npower and exponential growth in storage capabilities). While\\nAl-based tools are showing significant benefits, there is also an\\ninherent danger that several so-called AI industry experts may\\nuse these powerful technologies as a blackbox without deep\\nunderstanding of how they work and their inherent limitations.\\nII. LESSONS FROM THE PAST\\nSearch and optimization are key to all AI algorithms,\\nthese use different similarity measures (pattern matching) to\\nprovide guided search in representation or problem space. To\\naccomplish proper guiding, selection schemes, fitness function,\\nloss function, transfer function, matching functions have been\\nused to achieve to the desired goal. Most AI algorithms\\nare probabilistic where the results need to be converted to\\ndecision or recommendation space. In general, performances\\nof AI algorithms largely depend on tuning various control\\nparameters (both internal and external), mapping functions,\\nencoding schemes, distance measures, recognition thresholds,\\nmeta-heuristics, etc. Also for a specific application, hybridiza-\\ntion of AI techniques, data pre-processing (sampling and di-\\nmensionality reduction) and post-processing (output filtering,\\nand visual interpretation) play important roles in algorithmic\\nsuccess\\nA.
